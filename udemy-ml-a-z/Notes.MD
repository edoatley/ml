## Code

Downloaded this to [here](./Machine%20Learning%20A-Z%20(Codes%20and%20Datasets)/)

## R setup

- Installed CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Installed R-studio from [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

When running code in R studio it is sensible to set the context to the correct working directory from the more menu in the
bottom right panel of the UI

## Notes

### Feature scaling

- Normalization:
  - for each value take subtract the minimum and divide by (max - min)
  - end result is a value between 0 and 1
- Standardisation
  - take away the average and divide by standard deviation
  - result is (mostly) between -3 and +3 and is the number of standard deviations from the mean (can get extreme outliers outside the range)
