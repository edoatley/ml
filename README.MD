## Research 

Need to better understand:

1. sources of historical share price data
2. influences on share price
3. architecture and models we can use to make predictions

## Architecture

- import historical data into a suitable data store - need to clean and standardise the data
- create a simple model to predict the next days price - could start with increase or decrease
- train and run the model
- create an API that lets you query the results
